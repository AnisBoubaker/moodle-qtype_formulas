 <p>The following are the explanation of options in the editing page of 
formulas question type. These options are divided into the global 
options that affect the all subquestions answer and the local options 
for each individual answer. </p><p></p><p></p><hr><h1><a name="Question_text"></a>Question text<a href="#Question_text" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>In addition to the main question text, you can also use global variables and placeholder here. </p><p>The
 global variables will be replaced by its value and the placeholders 
will be replaced the subquestion. A simple example with variables <tt> A, B, C </tt> and placeholders <tt> #1, #2, #3 </tt> are shown. </p><pre class="prettyprint">What is the result of {A} + {B}?<br>{#1}<br>What is the result of {A} - {B}?<br>{#2}<br>What is the result of {C} / {B}?<br>{#3}</pre><hr><h1><a name="Random_variables"></a>Random variables<a href="#Random_variables" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>New
 random values can be generated whenever a question is created.  It can 
be done by defining a set of elements to choose from: </p><pre class="prettyprint">A = {1,2,3};<br>C = {[1,-1], [2,-2], [3,-3]};<br>E = {10:100:10, 100, 1000};</pre><p>The
 elements can be number, string or lists of them. During the start of a 
quiz, one element will be drawn from the set and assign to the variable 
on the left.  Also, for the set of number, you can use the range 
notation like 10:100:10 (e.g. E). </p><h1><a name="Global_variables"></a>Global variables<a href="#Global_variables" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>Formula
 can be specified here to manipulate the instantiated random variables 
(all random variables are included here). The full list of mathematical 
function and operation is given in the documentation. </p><pre class="prettyprint">a = 1.11111;<br>b = exp(3);<br>c = A + a + b;<br>d = sin(1.5*pi()) + c;<br>e = round(a, 0);<br>f = [0,1,2,3][A];<br>g = ["zero","one","two","three"][A];<br>distance = sqrt(a*a + b*b);</pre><h1><a name="Per_answer_grading_result"></a>Per answer grading result<a href="#Per_answer_grading_result" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>Grading results can be shown for each subquestion/answer, instead of whole question. </p><h1><a name="Per_answer_submit_button"></a>Per answer submit button<a href="#Per_answer_submit_button" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>This option only has effect in the adaptive mode. </p><p>Submission button can be shown for each subquestion/answer, instead of whole question. </p><h1><a name="Global_-_Trial_mark_sequence"></a>Global - Trial mark sequence<a href="#Global_-_Trial_mark_sequence" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>This option only has effect in the adaptive mode. Required. </p><p>This
 option will override the behavior of penalty in adaptive mode. Default 
behaviour of adaptive mode always has infinite trial and deduct equal 
mark for each wrong trial.  With this option, both finite trial or 
infinite trials can be used. For finite trial, say, you want to have 
three trials, the first one has 100%, second one has 60% and third one 
has 20%, you can type: </p><pre class="prettyprint">1.00, 0.6, 0.2</pre><p>If you want to have infinite trial, each has 10% penalty, you can end the sequence by a comma: </p><pre class="prettyprint">1, 0.9,</pre><h1><a name="Global_-_Deduction_for_wrong_unit"></a>Global - Deduction for wrong unit<a href="#Global_-_Deduction_for_wrong_unit" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>This option specify the mark you want to penalize the student for a wrong unit. </p><p>It
 takes value between 0 to 1. If it takes value 1, the unit and answer 
must be correct at the same time in order to get mark. That is the unit 
and answer are treated as one entity. On the other hand, if it takes 
value 0, students can get full mark for only correct answer, all random 
string will have no effect at the end of answer. Therefore, it is 
recommended to use value 1 whenever the answer has no associated unit. </p><h1><a name="Global_-_Basic_conversion_rules"></a>Global - Basic conversion rules<a href="#Global_-_Basic_conversion_rules" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>This question type has a build-in unit conversion system and has basic conversion rules.  </p><p>The
 basic one is the "Common SI unit" rules that will convert standard unit
 such as unit for length, say, km, m, cm and mm. This option has no 
effect if no unit has been used. </p><hr><h1><a name="Default_answer_mark"></a>Default answer mark<a href="#Default_answer_mark" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>Required.
 The mark for the answer of this subquestion, which should be a number 
greater than 0. The default mark of the whole question is the sum of the
 default mark of all subquestions. </p><p>Note: If this answer mark field is left blank, this subquestion will be deleted when the question is successfully saved. </p><h1><a name="Local_variables"></a>Local variables<a href="#Local_variables" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>You
 can define variables here similar to the global variables. The scope 
includes all global variables and it can be used in the answer, 
subquestion and grading variables. Note that each subquestion has its 
own scope of local variables. </p><h1><a name="Answer_type"></a>Answer type<a href="#Answer_type" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>There
 are four answer types. The number, numeric and numerical formula 
requires a list of number as answer. The algebraic formula requires a 
list of string (formula) as answer. </p><p>Different answer type will 
impose different restriction while inputting answer, so students will 
need to know how to input them here. The format check in the quiz will 
also tell them when they type something wrong. Please read the 
documentation for details. </p><h1><a name="Answer"></a>Answer<a href="#Answer" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>Required.
 It is a list of number, or a list of string depending on the answer 
type chosen. When there is only one answer, a number or string can be 
entered directly. Please note that the number of elements in the list 
defines the number of answer box for this subquestion.  </p><pre class="prettyprint">123<br>[1, 0, 0, 1]<br>a<br>[1, a, b]<br>"exp(-a t)"<br>["vx t","vy t - 0.5 a t^2"]</pre><h1><a name="Grading_variables"></a>Grading variables<a href="#Grading_variables" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>This scope include all local variables and the responses from the student. See documentation for the advance usage. </p><h1><a name="Grading_criteria"></a>Grading criteria<a href="#Grading_criteria" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>Required.
 You can choose either relative error and absolute error with error 
range. Please note that relative error cannot be used in the algebraic 
answer type. </p><p>For the precise definition of the relative error and absolute error when there is more than one answer box, see documentation. </p><h1><a name="Unit"></a>Unit<a href="#Unit" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>You
 can specify the unit here. It is specially designed for SI unit, so an 
empty space represents the 'product' of different 'base unit' and <tt> ^ </tt> for the exponent. Also, <tt> / </tt> can be used for inverse exponent. Any permutation of the base unit are treated the same. </p><p>Students are required to use the same input format. For example, </p><pre class="prettyprint">1 m<br>0.1 m^2<br>20 m s^(-1)<br>400 kg m/s<br>100 kW</pre><h1><a name="Other_rules"></a>Other rules<a href="#Other_rules" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>It defines the conversion rules for other accepted base units. See documentation for the advance usage. </p><h1><a name="Placeholder"></a>Placeholder<a href="#Placeholder" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>A
 placeholder is a used to identify the location in the main question 
text that will be replaced by the content in the subquestion. It is a 
string of alphanumeric characters prefixed by '<strong>#</strong>', such as #1, #2a, #2b and #A. </p><p>If
 this field is left empty, the content in the subquestion answer format 
will be appended at the end of the main question text. </p><h1><a name="Subquestion_text"></a>Subquestion text<a href="#Subquestion_text" class="section_anchor"></a></h1><p>Subquestion text and the arrangement of answer boxes can be specified here. The answer box placeholders that can be used are: </p><pre class="prettyprint">{_0}<br>{_1}<br>{_2}<br>...<br>{_u}</pre><p>The <tt> {_0}, {_1}, {_2} </tt> are the input boxes for numbers and <tt> {_u} </tt> is the input box for unit. </p><p>All missing box are automatically appended at the end. A special case is that if <tt> {_0}, {_u} </tt> are specified consecutively, and there is only one numerical answer and unit., i.e. <tt> {_0}{_u} </tt>, they will be combined into a single long input answer box for both answer and unit. </p>
